# Mini_project: complete_sequence analysis of the human TNF gene

# Objective
To apply bioinformatics skills learned in Module 1 to download, analyze, and interpret the
sequence of the human TNF gene, which encode a proinflammatory cytokine call TNF

# Project_Overview
In this mini project, you will perform a series of bioinformatics tasks using the human TNF
gene as your sequence of interest. The project will guide you through downloading the
sequence, translating it, finding ORFs, analyzing sequence composition, identifying
transcription factor binding sites, searching for functional motifs, predicting coding/noncoding regions, and converting sequence file formats
